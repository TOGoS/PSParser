Parser for languages based on my generalized Parenthetical Syntax

  this is a function (
    argument!,
    another argument,
    'a symbol containing non-word characters like +, *, ()',
    "A literal string!",
    a symbol with 'only the last word quoted'
    some expression + some other expression,
    this one has a : colon in it,
    this one has a @ at sign in it,
    "colon is just another infix operator, you know"
  )

Symbols are parsed as 'phrases' which contain 'words'.
Characters between single quotes (other than backslash escape sequences) are
all interpreted literally as part of the word.

Infix operators are configurable.

Ths parser does not attempt to interpret expressions.
It only converts text to an expression tree.

ASTNode subclasses:

  Word
    - text : String
  Phrase
    - words : List<Word>
  LiteralString
    - quote style : QuoteStyle 
    - text : String
  Parameterization
    - subject : ASTNode
    - arguments : List<Expression>
  InfixExpression
    - a : Expression
    - operator : Word
    - b : Expression 

  schemaschema.Statement
    - head : ASTNode
    - body : List<Statement>

Number literals are not treated specially.
They are just words.

It should be possible to easily extend the parser to e.g.
  - give meaning to different brackets, possibly as string quoting mechanisms.
  - give meaning to newlines after a root expression

Syntax:
  
  root expression = command | expression
  command = expression block
  block = "{" command* "}"
  expression = prefix-operation | infix-operation | function-application | phrase | literal-string
  prefix-operation = prefix-operator expression
  infix-operation = expression infix-operator expression
  function-application = expression "(" expression ")"
  phrase = word+

Uses:

  Functional expressions

  SchemaSchema extends this syntax to include 'statements'
  
  TOGoSNoise3 could in theory be modified to use this syntax.
